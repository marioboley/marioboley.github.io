Due to its interest in rare phenomena, scientific discovery typically resembles the proverbial hunt for the needle in a haystack. Materials science seeks stable materials that have desired properties within huge combinatorial spaces.
Neuroscience looks for accurate and specific explanations of critical neuro-electric phenomena like seizures or alpha-rhythms in infinite parameter spaces of dynamical brain models. To achieve progress in such daunting pursuits, the modern scientific approach is to sample high-dimensional data collections of the domain of inquiry and then rely on data analysis method to uncover the phenomena of interest. In this project, we enable the data-driven discovery of valuable rare phenomena from such high-dimensional observational data collections.
