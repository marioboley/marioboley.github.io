Due to its interest in rare phenomena, scientific discovery typically resembles the proverbial hunt for the needle in a haystack. Materials science seeks stable materials that have desired properties within huge combinatorial spaces.
Neuroscience looks for accurate and specific explanations of critical neuro-electric phenomena like seizures or alpha-rhythms in infinite parameter spaces of dynamical brain models. Through this project, we enable the data-driven discovery of such important rare phenomena from high-dimensional observational data collections.
