excerpt: 'Presents a novel method for tuning the regularization hyper-parameter, λ, of a ridge regression that is faster to compute than leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) while yielding estimates of the regression parameters of equal, or particularly in the setting of sparse covariates, superior quality to those obtained by minimising the LOOCV risk'

Ridge regression is one of the most widely used methods to fit linear regression models. Surprisingly, the established method for estimating its optimal shrinkage hyper-parameter value can be rather inaccurate. We show how a Bayesian formulation can address this issue.
