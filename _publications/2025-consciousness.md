**Abstract:** Waking levels of human consciousness are known to be supported by the integrity of complex structures and processes in the brain, yet how they are exactly regulated by neurobiological mechanisms remains uncertain. Here a space-time-resolved inference-based framework is applied to estimate the neurophysiological variables of a whole-cortex model and analyze the neural mechanism correlates of global consciousness by way of a correlation analysis between behavioural and neural variable time-series. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from 15 participants under Xenon-induced anesthesia, interconnected neural mass models (NMMs) were developed and time-evolving regional neurophysiological variables and inter-regional connectivity strengths were inferred from the data. Analyses revealed significant correlations between consciousness levels and inter-regional connectivity, particularly in posterior parietal, occipital, and prefrontal regions. Moreover, results support a parietal, rather than frontal, network backbone to facilitate global consciousness. Regional level analyses further identified correlates of consciousness within the posterior parietal and occipital regions. Lastly, reductions in consciousness were linked to stabilized cortical dynamics, reflected by changes in the eigenmodes of the system. This framework provides a novel, inference-based approach to investigating consciousness, offering a time-resolved perspective on neural mechanism correlates during altered states.
